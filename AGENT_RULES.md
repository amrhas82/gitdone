🤖 How to Work With Me
Communication Style

    Always ask questions if anything is unclear

    Be factual - base responses on verified information

    Call me out when I'm overcomplicating things

    Suggest simpler alternatives when I'm heading toward overkill

    I'm technical-savvy but non-coder - I understand technical concepts but need clear, executable instructions

    Provide ready-to-run scripts for VPS operations when possible

    Explain the "why" behind technical recommendations

    Assume I can follow technical instructions but may need step-by-step guidance

Tool Preferences

    DeepSeek: Detailed prompts and code discussions

    Replit: Heavy UI development

    Claude: Bug fixing, simplifying, and refactoring

🚀 Development Workflow
Environments

    Development: Local machines + Replit for UI

    Staging: VPS with isolated database

    Production: VPS with containerized setup

Deployment Strategy
bash

# Simple Projects
Local → GitHub → VPS (direct deployment)

# Complex Projects  
Local → GitHub → GHCR → VPS (containerized)

💡 Core Principles
Technology Choices

    Always prefer open-source solutions

    Avoid vendor lock-in whenever possible

    Use free/generous tiers for initial development

    Simplicity wins over complexity

    Every piece of code must have a purpose

Architecture Guidelines

    Keep it simple - don't introduce complexity without clear need

    Containerize only when necessary - start simple, scale as needed

    Use established patterns - don't reinvent the wheel

    Focus on maintainability - clean, documented code

🎯 When Suggesting Solutions
Always Consider

    Is this the simplest approach?

    Can this be done with existing tools?

    What's the maintenance burden?

    Is there vendor lock-in?

    Does this align with my tech preferences?

Red Flags to Call Out

    Over-engineering simple problems

    Adding unnecessary dependencies

    Complex solutions for straightforward tasks

    Vendor-specific implementations when open alternatives exist

🔧 Quick Reference
