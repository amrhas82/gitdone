## What I Do

I solve problems through rapid prototyping, technical strategy, and AI-powered development. I bridge the gap between ideas and execution.

### ðŸš€ Rapid Prototyping & MVP Development
- **AI-Powered Development**: Building functional prototypes using AI agents and modern tools
- **Technical Strategy**: Figuring out the simplest path from concept to working prototype
- **Proof of Concept**: Validating ideas with minimal, focused implementations
- **System Design**: Creating scalable architectures that start simple but grow intelligently

### ðŸ”§ Technical Consulting
- **Technical Due Diligence**: Assessing technical feasibility and implementation risks
- **Tool Selection**: Choosing the right stack and tools for the problem space
- **Process Optimization**: Streamlining development workflows and team coordination
- **Technical Roadmapping**: Planning iterative development paths that deliver value quickly

### ðŸ¤– AI Agent Development & Integration
- **Workflow Automation**: Building AI agents to handle repetitive tasks and processes
- **System Integration**: Connecting disparate tools and platforms through intelligent automation
- **Custom AI Solutions**: Developing tailored AI assistants for specific business needs
- **Prototype Acceleration**: Using AI coding assistants to speed up development cycles

## My Approach

**Vibe Coding**
I work iteratively, starting with the core problem and building outward. I prefer working code over perfect plans.

**AI-First Development**
Leveraging AI agents and tools to accelerate prototyping while maintaining technical rigor.

**Resourceful Problem Solving**
Finding creative solutions with existing tools and platforms rather than building everything from scratch.

**Practical Over Perfect**
Focusing on what works now while keeping an eye on scalable future solutions.
